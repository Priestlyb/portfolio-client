        <p>
          As a skilled Software Engineer with over 4 years of self development
          experience, I specialize in building responsive, user-friendly
          websites using technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and
          TypeScript and a bit of Node.js. My portfolio showcases a range of
          projects that demonstrate my expertise in web development and my
          ability to deliver high-quality, visually stunning websites. I have a
          strong understanding of SEO best practices and I always strive to
          create websites that are not only visually appealing, but also
          optimized for search engines.
